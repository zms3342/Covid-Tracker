# ABOUT
  This app is a covid-19 tracker dashboard. There is a map with bubble visualizations showing how much of the population in a given region is infected, recovered, or dead. There is also a graph tracking the daily change over the last 120 days for each metric. The page was built using ReactJs with data from https://disease.sh API.
